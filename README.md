- **[aggregate-details-enhancement.md](research/aggregate-details-enhancement.md)** - Detailed aggregate and entity documentation with relationships, workflows, and dependencies

### Key Resources

**IT Decision Package** provides executive-level materials for strategic technical decisions:
- Option analysis (continue vs retire Enrollment Builder)
- Timeline impact assessment (4-month difference)
- Risk analysis (87.6% risk reduction with recommended option)
- Cost-benefit analysis ($180K-$240K impact)
- Implementation roadmap through April 2026
- Visual diagrams and quantitative metrics

**Domain Documentation** provides comprehensive implementation guidance:
- 13 core domain aggregates (ESA+ and Opportunity Scholarship)
- Detailed attribute descriptions
- Relationship diagrams and dependencies
- Concrete workflow examples
- Business rule invariants
- Source references to NC statutes and program rules

Perfect for understanding domain model implementation, aggregate boundaries, and context integration.
