NC K12 Scholarship programs (ESA+ and Opportunity Scholarship) - Domain-Driven Design research and documentation.

## Documentation

### ðŸš€ Execution Roadmap (Start Here)

- **[EXECUTION-ROADMAP.md](EXECUTION-ROADMAP.md)** - **ACTIVE**: High-velocity delivery plan (Oct 2025 - May 1, 2026)
  - 4 parallel team tracks (16 full-stack developers)
  - 7-month timeline with monthly initiative milestones
  - Startup mode approach with minimal process overhead
  - Critical dependencies and risk mitigation
  - Concurrent development strategy

### IT Stakeholder Decision Materials

- **[Stakeholder Decision Package](stakeholder-decision/README.md)** - **NEW**: Comprehensive IT decision materials for Enrollment Builder strategic decision
  - [Decision Brief](stakeholder-decision/decision-brief.md) - 2-3 page executive summary with recommendation
  - [Presentation Deck](stakeholder-decision/presentation-deck.md) - 23-slide stakeholder presentation
  - [Timeline Comparison](stakeholder-decision/diagrams/timeline-comparison.md) - Gantt charts and critical path analysis
  - [Risk Matrix](stakeholder-decision/diagrams/risk-matrix.md) - Comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategies
  - [Dependency Map](stakeholder-decision/diagrams/dependency-map.md) - Architecture diagrams and integration dependencies

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Research

- **[ddd-1.md](research/ddd-1.md)** - Initial DDD analysis covering all NCSEAA programs
- **[ddd-2.md](research/ddd-2.md)** - Focused ESA+ and OS domain analysis
- **[full-domain.md](research/full-domain.md)** - Comprehensive statutory and domain analysis
- **[aggregate-details-enhancement.md](research/aggregate-details-enhancement.md)** - Detailed aggregate and entity documentation with relationships, workflows, and dependencies

### Key Resources

**IT Decision Package** provides executive-level materials for strategic technical decisions:
- Option analysis (continue vs retire Enrollment Builder)
- Timeline impact assessment (4-month difference)
- Risk analysis (87.6% risk reduction with recommended option)
- Cost-benefit analysis ($180K-$240K impact)
- Implementation roadmap through April 2026
- Visual diagrams and quantitative metrics

**Domain Documentation** provides comprehensive implementation guidance:
- 13 core domain aggregates (ESA+ and Opportunity Scholarship)
- Detailed attribute descriptions
- Relationship diagrams and dependencies
- Concrete workflow examples
- Business rule invariants
- Source references to NC statutes and program rules

Perfect for understanding domain model implementation, aggregate boundaries, and context integration.
