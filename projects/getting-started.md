# Getting Started with Project Planning Documentation

## Welcome! 👋

This guide helps you navigate and use the project planning documentation effectively. Whether you're a Product Owner, Business Analyst, Developer, or Project Manager, this roadmap will help you get started.

---

## 🎯 Quick Start by Role

### If You're a Product Owner or Business Analyst

**Your Goal:** Extract initiatives, epics, and user stories from business requirements

**Start Here:**
1. 📖 Read [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md) (5 minutes)
2. 📖 Read [Project Planning Guide](project-planning-guide.md) - Focus on Steps 1-4 (30 minutes)
3. 📖 Skim [INVEST Format Guide](invest-format-guide.md) - Bookmark for reference (15 minutes)
4. ✅ Use templates in [Project Planning Guide](project-planning-guide.md) to start creating stories

**Pro Tip:** Use Gemini (per [AI Business Case Review](ai-business-case-review.md)) to draft initial stories, then refine with your domain knowledge.

---

### If You're a Developer or Technical Lead

**Your Goal:** Understand user stories and break them into implementation tasks

**Start Here:**
1. 📖 Read [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md) - Print for your desk (5 minutes)
2. 📖 Read [INVEST Format Guide](invest-format-guide.md) - Focus on "S" (Small) and "T" (Testable) (20 minutes)
3. 📖 Read [Work Item Hierarchy](work-item-hierarchy.md) - Focus on "Level 5: Task" section (15 minutes)
4. ✅ Use GitHub Copilot (per [AI Business Case Review](ai-business-case-review.md)) to accelerate implementation

**Pro Tip:** During sprint planning, break stories into 2-8 hour tasks. Copilot can help generate boilerplate code and tests.

---

### If You're a Project Manager or Scrum Master

**Your Goal:** Facilitate effective backlog refinement and sprint planning

**Start Here:**
1. 📖 Read [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md) (5 minutes)

3. 📖 Review [AI Business Case Review](ai-business-case-review.md) - Understand tool benefits and ROI (20 minutes)
4. ✅ Use checklists from [Project Planning Guide](project-planning-guide.md) in refinement sessions

**Pro Tip:** Use the "Story Refinement Checklist" before bringing stories into sprint planning.

---

### If You're an Executive or Stakeholder

**Your Goal:** Understand how AI tools accelerate project delivery

**Start Here:**
1. 📖 Read [AI Business Case Review](ai-business-case-review.md) - Executive Summary and Recommendations (10 minutes)
2. 📖 Skim [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md) - Understand INVEST principles (5 minutes)
3. ✅ Review ROI analysis: 4,267% return on Copilot, 30% time savings with Gemini

## 🛠️ Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: "I have a high-level feature idea and need to create user stories"

**Process:**
1. Open [Project Planning Guide](project-planning-guide.md) → Step 4: Create User Stories
2. Use the User Story Template
3. Apply INVEST checklist from [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md)
4. (Optional) Use Gemini to draft initial stories as shown in [AI Business Case Review](ai-business-case-review.md)
5. Refine with team during backlog refinement

---

### Use Case 2: "My user story is too large - how do I split it?"

**Process:**
1. Open [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md) → "Common Story Splitting Strategies"
2. Choose splitting technique:
   - By workflow steps (most common)
   - By CRUD operations
   - By user roles
   - By business rules
   - By acceptance criteria
3. Create separate stories for each split
4. Validate each story still meets INVEST criteria

**Time:** 15-30 minutes per large story

---

### Use Case 3: "I need to extract all work items from a business case document"

**Process:**
1. Open [Project Planning Guide](project-planning-guide.md) → "The Extraction Process"
2. Follow 5-step process:
   - Step 1: Identify Initiatives (strategic goals)
   - Step 2: Break into Epics (major features)
   - Step 3: Define Features (capabilities)
   - Step 4: Write User Stories (INVEST format)
   - Step 5: Create Tasks (implementation)
3. Use [Work Item Hierarchy](work-item-hierarchy.md) templates for each level
4. (Optional) Accelerate with Gemini for story generation

**Time:** 4-8 hours for comprehensive extraction (faster with AI tools)

---

### Use Case 4: "I want to understand the ROI of AI tools for our project"

**Process:**
1. Open [AI Business Case Review](ai-business-case-review.md)

5. Review "Recommendations and Action Items"

**Time:** 20 minutes

**Key Finding:** $126K value from Copilot vs $2,880 cost over 28 weeks. Gemini provides 30% time savings at $0 cost.

---

### Use Case 5: "I need to validate if our user stories are well-written"

**Process:**
1. Open [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md) → "INVEST Checklist"
2. Review each story against 6 criteria:
   - ✅ Independent - No blocking dependencies
   - ✅ Negotiable - Implementation flexible
   - ✅ Valuable - Clear business value
   - ✅ Estimable - Team can size it
   - ✅ Small - 2-5 days to complete
   - ✅ Testable - Clear acceptance criteria
3. For detailed validation, use [INVEST Format Guide](invest-format-guide.md) → each principle section
4. Fix common violations using examples in guide

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Better Story Writing

1. **Start with Value** - If you can't articulate value, question if story is needed
2. **Keep It Small** - Most stories should be 2-5 days (story points 2-5)
3. **Make It Testable** - Write acceptance criteria first, before implementation details
4. **Involve the Team** - Stories are conversation starters, not rigid contracts
5. **Use Examples** - Given/When/Then with concrete data makes criteria clearer

### For Effective Extraction

1. **Work Top-Down** - Don't start with tasks; start with initiatives
2. **Validate with Users** - Show stories to actual users early and often
3. **Use Domain Language** - Match terminology to domain glossary (K12-SEAA terms)
4. **Iterate Frequently** - First pass won't be perfect; plan for refinement
5. **Leverage AI Wisely** - AI drafts, humans validate and refine

### For AI Tool Success

1. **Clear Prompts Win** - Provide context, domain terms, and desired format
2. **Human Review is Mandatory** - Never accept AI output without validation
3. **Track Metrics Early** - Baseline before AI, measure after to show ROI
4. **Share Best Practices** - Team members learn from each other's AI usage
5. **Stay Secure** - Don't include PII or sensitive data in prompts
