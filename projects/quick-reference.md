# Project Planning Quick Reference Card

## INVEST Principles (1-Page Summary)

### User Story Format
```
As a [user role]
I want [functionality]
So that [business value]
```

### INVEST Checklist

âœ… **I - Independent**
- Can be developed in any order
- No blocking dependencies on other stories
- If dependencies exist, combine or reorder

âœ… **N - Negotiable**
- Focus on "what" and "why", not "how"
- Implementation details are flexible
- Discuss solutions during sprint planning

âœ… **V - Valuable**
- Delivers clear value to users, business, or technical capability
- Always articulate the benefit
- If no value, question if story is needed

âœ… **E - Estimable**
- Team can estimate relative effort
- If not estimable: needs refinement or spike
- Use story points, not hours

âœ… **S - Small**
- Completable within 2-5 days (one sprint)
- Can be demoed to stakeholders
- If too large, split using CRUD, workflow, or role

âœ… **T - Testable**
- Clear, objective acceptance criteria
- Use Given/When/Then or checklist format
- QA can verify without ambiguity

## Extraction Process (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Identify Initiatives
**Sources:** Business cases, strategic plans, compliance mandates  
**Output:** 1-3 strategic goals with success metrics  
**K12-SEAA Example:** "Modernize K12 Student Assistance Platform"

### Step 2: Break into Epics
**Sources:** Feature inventory, user journeys, domain analysis  
**Output:** 3-10 large feature sets per initiative  
**K12-SEAA Example:** "ESA+ Application & Enrollment" (20+ features)

### Step 3: Define Features
**Sources:** Epic requirements, business rules, workflows  
**Output:** 5-15 capabilities per epic  
**K12-SEAA Example:** "Income Verification" (6 stories)

### Step 4: Write User Stories
**Sources:** Feature requirements, acceptance criteria  
**Output:** 5-20 INVEST-compliant stories per feature  
**K12-SEAA Example:** "As a parent, I want to enter household income..."

### Step 5: Create Tasks
**Sources:** Story technical requirements  
**Output:** 3-10 implementation tasks per story

## Common Story Splitting Strategies

1. **By Workflow Steps**
   - Registration â†’ Profile â†’ Application â†’ Review â†’ Submit

2. **By CRUD Operations**
   - Create â†’ Read â†’ Update â†’ Delete

3. **By User Roles**
   - Parent view â†’ Admin view â†’ School view

4. **By Business Rules**
   - Simple case â†’ Complex case with exceptions

5. **By Data Attributes**
   - Basic info â†’ Additional info â†’ Special cases

6. **By Acceptance Criteria**
   - Each criterion becomes separate story

---

## Acceptance Criteria Formats

### Format 1: Given/When/Then
```
Given: [initial state]
When: [action occurs]
Then: [expected outcome]
```

### Format 2: Checklist
```
- [ ] Criterion 1 (specific, testable)
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3
```

### Format 3: Scenarios
```
Scenario 1: Happy path
- Expected behavior

Scenario 2: Edge case
- Expected behavior
```

## Story Sizing Guide

| Size | Duration | Description | Example |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | 2-4 hours | Trivial change | Update label text |
| 2 | 4-8 hours | Simple story | Add new field to form |
| 3 | 1-2 days | Standard story | Create basic CRUD page |
| 5 | 2-3 days | Complex story | Implement validation workflow |
| 8 | 3-5 days | Very complex | Integration with external API |
| 13 | 5+ days | Too large! | Split into smaller stories |

**Rule of Thumb:** Most stories should be 2-5 points

## Key Principles to Remember

1. **Start with Why** - Always articulate business value first
2. **Top-Down Planning** - Initiative â†’ Epic â†’ Feature â†’ Story â†’ Task
3. **User-Centric Stories** - Focus on user needs, not technical implementation
4. **Keep Stories Small** - 2-5 days maximum
5. **Make Testable** - Clear acceptance criteria are non-negotiable
6. **AI is a Tool** - Accelerates drafting, but humans validate
7. **Iterate and Refine** - First pass won't be perfect
8. **Collaborate** - Stories are conversation starters, not contracts
