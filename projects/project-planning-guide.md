## Step 1: Identify High-Level Initiatives

### What Is an Initiative?

An initiative is a **strategic business goal** that typically:
- Spans 6-18 months
- Requires significant investment ($500K - $5M+)
- Involves multiple teams and stakeholders
- Delivers measurable business outcomes

### Sources for Identifying Initiatives

1. **Strategic Planning Documents**
   - Business cases
   - Executive presentations
   - Board meeting minutes
   - Annual planning sessions

2. **Regulatory/Compliance Mandates**
   - New legislation requirements
   - Audit findings requiring remediation
   - Industry compliance standards

3. **Stakeholder Feedback**
   - Customer/user pain points
   - Operational inefficiencies
   - Market competitive pressures

4. **Technical Drivers**
   - End-of-life systems requiring replacement
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Performance/scalability issues

### K12-SEAA Example: Identifying the Initiative

## Step 2: Break Initiatives into Epics

### What Is an Epic?

An epic is a **large feature set or functional area** that:
- Takes 2-6 months to complete
- Can be broken into 10-50 user stories
- Delivers cohesive business value
- Has clear acceptance criteria

### Extraction Techniques

#### Technique 1: Functional Decomposition
Analyze the system by major functional areas:

- Payment systems
- Reporting and analytics
- etc.

#### Technique 2: User Journey Mapping
Follow user workflows end-to-end:
- Parent applies for funding
- Admin reviews application
- Payment is processed
- Compliance reporting occurs

#### Technique 3: Domain-Driven Design
Identify bounded contexts from domain analysis:
- ESA+ domain
- Opportunity Scholarship domain
- Provider Management domain
- Identity & Access domain

#### Technique 4: Existing System Analysis
Review current system features:
- What exists today that must be replaced?
- What new capabilities are required?
- What can be retired?

## Step 3: Define Features within Epics

### What Is a Feature?

A feature is a **specific product capability** that:
- Takes 2-4 weeks to implement (1-2 sprints)
- Can be broken into 5-15 user stories
- Delivers standalone value
- Can be tested independently

### Extraction Techniques

#### Technique 1: User Task Analysis
What specific tasks must users complete?
- Submit application
- Upload documents
- View status
- etc.

#### Technique 2: CRUD Breakdown
For each entity, what operations are needed?
- Create new application
- Read/view application
- Update application details
- Delete draft application

#### Technique 3: Workflow Steps
Break end-to-end process into phases:
- Registration → Application → Review → Decision → Award → Payment

#### Technique 4: Business Rules Identification
Each complex business rule may warrant a feature:
- Income eligibility calculation
- Award amount determination
- Compliance verification

---

## Step 4: Create User Stories (INVEST Format)

### What Is a User Story?

A user story is a **specific user requirement** that:
- Follows INVEST principles (see [INVEST Format Guide](invest-format-guide.md))
- Takes 2-5 days to implement
- Can be completed within a sprint
- Has clear, testable acceptance criteria

### Story Writing Process

#### Step 4.1: Use the Standard Template
```
As a [user role]
I want [functionality]
So that [business value]
```

#### Step 4.2: Add Acceptance Criteria
Use Given/When/Then or checklist format:
```
Given [initial context]
When [action occurs]
Then [expected outcome]
```

#### Step 4.3: Validate INVEST Criteria
- **I**ndependent - Can develop in any order
- **N**egotiable - Details are flexible
- **V**aluable - Delivers clear value
- **E**stimable - Team can estimate effort
- **S**mall - Fits in one sprint
- **T**estable - Has verifiable criteria

### K12-SEAA Example: Stories for a Feature

## Using AI Tools for Extraction

### Leveraging Gemini for Requirements Capture

Per the [AI Business Case](../AI%20Business%20Case.pdf), Randstad's Gemini instance can accelerate story extraction by 30%.

### Effective Prompting Strategy

#### Prompt Template for Gemini
```
Context: [Brief project/domain description]
Source: [Meeting notes, requirements doc, or high-level description]
Output Format: INVEST-compliant user stories with acceptance criteria

Task: Generate user stories for [epic/feature name]

Include:
- User role identification
- Clear value statement
- Given/When/Then acceptance criteria
- Edge cases
- Validation rules
```

#### K12-SEAA Example Prompt

```
Context: K12-SEAA modernization project. Building platform for North 
Carolina families to apply for education assistance (ESA+, Opportunity 
Scholarship). Admins review and approve applications.

Source: Families need to verify their household income by uploading 
documents (W2s, pay stubs, tax returns). NCSEAA staff review documents 
and either approve or request additional documentation. Income is 
compared against NC eligibility thresholds (e.g., 200% of federal 
poverty line adjusted by household size). Status must be visible to 
families at all times.

Output Format: INVEST-compliant user stories with Given/When/Then 
acceptance criteria

Task: Generate user stories for Income Verification feature

Include:
- Parent perspective stories
- Admin perspective stories
- System/calculation stories
- Document upload and review workflows
- Edge cases (missing docs, invalid file types, expired documents)
- Validation rules for income amounts and household size
```

#### Gemini Output (Example)

```
Epic: Income Verification

Feature 1: Income Information Capture

Story 1: Enter Household Income Details
As a parent applying for ESA+, I want to enter my household income 
and size so that the system can determine my eligibility.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given: I am logged in and on the income information page
When: I enter my gross annual income and household size
Then:
  - Income must be a positive number between $0 and $999,999
  - Household size must be an integer between 1 and 20
  - Real-time validation displays errors if invalid
  - Form auto-saves every 30 seconds
  - I can proceed to next step when valid
  
Edge Cases:
  - Income of $0 should prompt confirmation ("Is this correct?")
  - Household size > 10 should prompt verification
  - If network fails during auto-save, show warning message

---

Story 2: Upload Income Documentation
As a parent, I want to upload W2 forms and pay stubs to verify my 
income so my application can be approved.

Acceptance Criteria:
Given: I have entered income information
When: I upload income documents
Then:
  - Accept PDF, JPG, PNG file types only
  - Each file must be < 10MB
  - Can upload up to 10 files total
  - Display upload progress bar
  - Show success confirmation with file name
  - List all uploaded files
  - Can delete uploaded files before submission
  
Edge Cases:
  - Reject .exe, .zip, or other executable types
  - If file is too large, suggest compression
  - If virus detected, reject with clear error message
  - If upload fails, allow retry

[... continues with more stories ...]
```

### Human Refinement Process

After Gemini generates stories, humans must:

1. **Validate Business Rules**
   - Verify income thresholds match NC regulations
   - Check household size limits are accurate
   - Confirm file type restrictions align with security policy

2. **Add Technical Constraints**
   - Specify APIs and database tables
   - Identify integration points (e.g., ClassWallet)
   - Note technical dependencies

3. **Adjust Priorities**
   - Reorder based on implementation phases
   - Mark MVP vs. nice-to-have features
   - Align with stakeholder urgency

4. **Estimate Story Points**
   - Development team estimates relative effort
   - Identify stories that are too large (split further)

5. **Link to Epic/Feature Hierarchy**
   - Ensure story fits within feature and epic structure
   - Tag with appropriate labels for tracking

---

### Example 2: Using Domain-Driven Design for Extraction

From [DDD Research](../research/ddd-1.md) and [DDD-2](../research/ddd-2.md), we identified bounded contexts:

**Bounded Context:** ESA+ Services

**Aggregates Identified:**
- `Household(householdId)`
- `Student(studentId)`
- `ESAAccount(esaId)`
- `Application(applicationId)`
- `Award(awardId)`
- `Disbursement(disbId)`

**Each Aggregate → Epic/Feature:**

**Aggregate:** Application(applicationId)

**Epic:** Application Management

**Features:**
1. Create Application (CRUD on Application aggregate)
2. Application Status Workflow (state machine)
3. Application Review (admin operations)
4. Application Submission (business rules validation)

**Stories for Feature "Create Application":**
1. Initialize new application
2. Save application draft
3. Retrieve saved application
4. Update application details
5. Delete draft application

---

### Example 3: Phased Implementation Approach

From [Comprehensive Implementation Plan](../stakeholder-decision/comprehensive-implementation-plan.md), the project is divided into 9 phases over 28 weeks.

**Extraction Strategy:**

**Phase 1: Foundation & Core Applications (Weeks 1-8)**
- Focus on critical path features
- Prioritize epics: Household Management, ESA+ Application, Authentication

**Phase 2: Cross-Cutting Services (Weeks 9-12)**
- Infrastructure features
- Prioritize epics: Notifications, Document Management, Integration APIs

**Phase 3: Advanced Workflows & Admin (Weeks 13-16)**
- Admin portal features
- Prioritize epics: Admin Operations, Reporting, Exception Handling

**Phase 4-6: Financial, School, Compliance (Weeks 17-22)**
- Specialized features
- Prioritize epics: Payment Systems, School Management, Compliance Reporting

**Phases 7-9: Testing & Launch (Weeks 23-28)**
- Focus on quality, not new features
- User acceptance testing, defect resolution, production readiness

**Story Extraction by Phase:**
- Identify MVP (Must-Have) stories for Phase 1
- Defer nice-to-have stories to Phase 2 (post-launch)
- Use MoSCoW prioritization: Must, Should, Could, Won't (for now)

---

## Best Practices and Pitfalls

### Best Practices

#### 1. Start with the "Why"
Always articulate business value before writing stories.

**Good:**
```
Initiative: Reduce application processing time from 4 weeks to 1 week
Epic: Automated Income Verification
Story: As an admin, I want automated eligibility calculation...
```

**Why:** Clear line from strategic goal to implementation

---

#### 2. Involve the Right People
- **Initiatives:** Executives, PMO
- **Epics:** Product Owners, Business Stakeholders
- **Features:** Product Owners, UX Designers
- **Stories:** Product Owners, Development Team, QA
- **Tasks:** Development Team

**Why:** Each level requires different expertise

---

#### 3. Use Consistent Terminology
Create a domain glossary and enforce it.

**K12-SEAA Glossary Examples:**
- "Application" not "Request" or "Form"
- "Household" not "Family"
- "Award" not "Grant" or "Allocation"
- "Disbursement" not "Payment"

**Why:** Reduces confusion, improves AI-generated story quality

---

#### 4. Validate with Real Users
Don't extract in a vacuum. Show stories to actual parents, admins, schools.

**Process:**
1. Extract draft stories
2. Review with 2-3 representative users
3. Identify gaps or misunderstandings
4. Refine and re-validate

**Why:** Assumptions are often wrong; users know best

---

#### 5. Iterate and Refine
First pass won't be perfect. Plan for story refinement sessions.

**Cadence:**
- Weekly backlog refinement (1-2 hours)
- Stories for upcoming sprint must be "ready"
- Definition of Ready checklist

**Why:** Stories evolve as understanding deepens

---

### Common Pitfalls

#### Pitfall 1: Starting Too Small ❌
**Mistake:** Writing tasks or detailed stories before defining epics

**Example:**
Immediately writing "Create login button" before defining "User Authentication" epic

**Solution:** Work top-down (Initiative → Epic → Feature → Story → Task)

---

#### Pitfall 2: Making Stories Too Large ❌
**Mistake:** Stories that take weeks to complete

**Example:**
"As a parent, I want to apply for ESA+ funding" (this is an epic!)

**Solution:** Apply [INVEST](invest-format-guide.md) "S" criterion - stories should be small (2-5 days)

---

#### Pitfall 3: Writing Technical Stories Without Value ❌
**Mistake:** "Refactor database layer to use repository pattern"

**Solution:** Connect to business value:
"As a developer, I want a consistent data access pattern so queries are testable and maintainable (reducing bugs and onboarding time)"

---

#### Pitfall 4: Vague Acceptance Criteria ❌
**Mistake:** "System should be fast" or "User interface should be intuitive"

**Solution:** Make criteria specific and measurable:
- "Dashboard loads in < 2 seconds with 100 concurrent users"
- "95% of users complete application without help docs (measured in usability testing)"

---

#### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Dependencies ❌
**Mistake:** Creating "independent" stories that secretly depend on each other

**Example:**
- Story A: "Upload documents"
- Story B: "View uploaded documents"
- Hidden dependency: B requires A's backend storage to exist

**Solution:** Document dependencies explicitly, consider combining into vertical slice
