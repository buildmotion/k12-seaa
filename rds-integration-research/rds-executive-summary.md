## üîë Key Findings

### What We Know ‚úÖ

**RDS Business Purpose:**
- Centralized residency determination for all NC higher education institutions
- Operated by NCSEAA in partnership with College Foundation, Inc. (CFI)
- Established to ensure consistent residency classifications statewide
- Reusable determination across multiple institutions and aid programs

**Process Workflow:**
1. **Initial Consideration** ‚Üí Student submits documents, RDS determines resident/non-resident
2. **Reconsideration** ‚Üí Student circumstances change, can request re-evaluation
3. **Appeal** ‚Üí Formal appeal process overseen by State Education Assistance Authority
4. **Reuse** ‚Üí Once determined, classification applies to all NC institutions

**Statutory Framework:**
- **G.S. 115C-562.3** mandates electronic verification across state agencies:
  - DMV (driver's license validation)
  - DPI (school enrollment records)
  - Department of Revenue (tax filings)
  - DHHS (benefits enrollment)
  - Department of Commerce (employment)
  - State Board of Elections (voter registration)

**K-12 Residency Requirements:**
- 12-month NC domicile requirement
- Documents: NC driver's license, utility bills, bank statements, tax records
- Currently verified via **MyPortal document upload** (not RDS integration)

### What We DON'T Know ‚ùå

**Critical Unknowns:**
- ‚ùå Does RDS provide an API for third-party integration?
- ‚ùå Is K-12 scholarship verification in scope for RDS?
- ‚ùå What authentication method is used? (OAuth, API keys, SAML?)
- ‚ùå Real-time vs. batch processing capabilities?
- ‚ùå Webhook/callback support for status notifications?
- ‚ùå Performance SLAs (response time, availability)?
- ‚ùå Integration onboarding timeline?
- ‚ùå Cost structure (if any) for API access?
- ‚ùå Support model and SLAs?

**Architectural Uncertainty:**
- May be **web portal only** (no programmatic API)
- May be **higher-ed focused** (K-12 out of scope)
- May require **batch file exchange** instead of real-time API
- May require **net-new development** to support K-12 use cases

---

## üéØ Critical Questions for Meeting

### Must Answer (üî¥ Critical Priority)

1. **Does RDS provide a programmatic API?**
   - If yes ‚Üí Get documentation, sandbox access, onboarding timeline
   - If no ‚Üí Discuss roadmap for API development or alternative integration methods

2. **Is RDS designed to support K-12 residency verification?**
   - If yes ‚Üí Proceed with integration planning
   - If no ‚Üí Discuss requirements for extending RDS to K-12 programs

3. **What is the integration timeline?**
   - Onboarding process steps?
   - Required approvals (MOU, security review)?
   - Fast-track possibilities?

4. **What authentication mechanism is required?**
   - OAuth 2.0, API keys, mTLS, SAML?
   - Credential issuance and rotation process?

5. **Real-time API calls or batch processing only?**
   - Response time for determinations?
   - Webhook support for async notifications?

## üö® Blind Spots & Risks

### üî¥ HIGH RISK

**No Public API Documentation**
- **Impact:** Cannot plan integration architecture with certainty
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Prepare for multiple scenarios (API, batch, manual)
  - Build fallback manual verification in MyPortal
  - Advocate for API development if needed

**K-12 Scope Unclear**
- **Impact:** RDS may be higher-ed only, requiring alternative verification
- **Mitigation:**
  - Establish executive sponsorship for K-12 integration
  - Demonstrate business value (30K+ Opportunity Scholarship students)
  - Explore alternative state agency APIs (DMV, DPI directly)

**Integration Timeline Unknown**
- **Impact:** K-12 system launch may be delayed
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement interim manual verification workflow
  - Negotiate fast-track onboarding
  - Phased rollout (pilot with 10% of applications)

### üü° MEDIUM RISK

**Dual System Architecture (MyPortal + RDS)**
- **Impact:** Data duplication, conflicting determinations
- **Mitigation:**
  - Define authoritative source of truth
  - Implement data reconciliation process
  - Clear user communication about verification method

**Performance Unknown**
- **Impact:** May not support real-time user experience
- **Mitigation:**
  - Design async workflow (notify parent when determination complete)
  - Aggressive caching strategy
  - Optimistic eligibility (assume resident, verify later)

## üìû Next Action Required

**üéØ PRIMARY ACTION:** Schedule meeting with RDS system owners (NCSEAA/CFI)

**Meeting Request Email Template:**

```
Subject: Request for Technical Discovery Meeting - K-12 System Integration with RDS

Dear [RDS Technical Lead],

I am the architect for the K-12 SEAA software system currently under development 
for the Opportunity Scholarship and ESA+ programs. We are exploring integration 
with the NC Residency Determination Service (RDS) for residency verification.

I have conducted preliminary research on RDS and prepared a comprehensive list 
of technical questions. I would like to schedule a 90-120 minute technical 
discovery meeting to discuss:

1. RDS API capabilities and integration options
2. K-12 program support and scope
3. Authentication, security, and compliance requirements
4. Integration timeline and onboarding process

Could we schedule a meeting in the next 1-2 weeks? I can provide an agenda 
and question list in advance.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
K-12 System Architect
```
