# Presentation Notes

## Delivery Guidance

**Tone:** Professional, comprehensive, solution-oriented, confident

**Key Messages to Emphasize:**
1. This is a complete scope presentation - all features inventoried
2. Timeline is achievable with disciplined execution
3. We have a clear plan with realistic phases
4. Risks are identified with mitigation strategies
5. Success depends on stakeholder support and decision-making

**Anticipated Questions (and Responses):**

**Question:** "How do we know we can complete 110+ features in 28 weeks?"
- **Response:** "We're using proven technology patterns (Angular reactive forms, .NET APIs) that allow for rapid, parallel development. Our phased approach allows multiple teams to work simultaneously. The Gantt chart shows realistic timelines based on industry standards for similar work. Plus, we have 6 weeks dedicated to testing and 2 weeks buffer."

**Question:** "What happens if we encounter delays with state agency integrations?"
- **Response:** "State agency integrations are in Phase 3 (January), giving us time to coordinate. We have manual fallback workflows planned for each agency. We're prioritizing early communication and have dedicated integration team resources. If an agency is delayed, we can proceed with manual verification temporarily."

**Question:** "Is there room for additional features stakeholders might request?"
- **Response:** "We have a formal change control process. Any new features will be evaluated against: 1) Impact on May 1 deadline, 2) Resource availability, 3) Business priority. Most new requests will be candidates for Phase 2. Our commitment is to deliver the core 110+ features on time with high quality."

**Question:** "How confident are you in the May 1, 2026 deadline?"
- **Response:** "We're confident because: 1) This plan uses proven technology, 2) We have adequate resources (6-8 FTE), 3) We have realistic phase durations with buffers, 4) We've identified and mitigated key risks, 5) We have parallel development capability. The biggest threat to the deadline would be uncontrolled scope creep, which we'll manage through change control."

**Question:** "What about the Enrollment Builder - is it completely abandoned?"
- **Response:** "No, it's deferred to Phase 2 evaluation. We'll collect actual data on form change frequency and administrative burden during Phase 1 operation. This data will inform a fact-based decision about whether to resurrect the Builder, use a commercial alternative, or continue with reactive forms. The focus now is on delivering core functionality on time."

**Closing:** "This comprehensive plan gives us a clear roadmap to success. We have the scope, timeline, resources, and risk management strategies needed to deliver by May 1, 2026. What we need from this group is support, timely decision-making, and help removing obstacles. Are there any final questions or concerns?"

# End of Presentation

### What Happens to Enrollment Builder?

**Not Abandoned – Re-evaluated**

**Phase 2 Planning (Post-April 2026):**
1. Analyze Phase 1 operational data:
   - How often do forms actually change?
   - What types of changes occur?
   - Is developer involvement truly a bottleneck?

2. Consider alternative solutions:
   - Low-code platforms (OutSystems, Mendix)
   - Form-as-a-Service solutions (Typeform, JotForm Enterprise)
   - Headless CMS with form builders (Contentful, Strapi)
   - Continue with reactive forms (if working well)

3. Make data-driven decision:
   - Actual ROI calculation based on real usage
   - Technical debt assessment from Phase 1
   - Budget and resource availability

**Key Principle:** Validate assumptions before major investment

---

## Slide 18: Stakeholder Communication Plan

## Slide 20: Decision Framework

### What We Need from This Meeting

**Required Decision:** Select Option A or Option B

**Decision Criteria:**
1. **Hard Deadline:** Can we miss the May 1, 2026 deadline? (Option A will miss it)
2. **Contract Compliance:** Can we delay project completion by 6+ months? (Option A will)
3. **Business Priority:** Is Enrollment Builder more important than meeting committed deadlines?
4. **Risk Tolerance:** Can we accept 75% probability of schedule overrun (Option A)?
5. **Resource Reality:** Can we sustain 50%+ allocation to Builder while other features suffer?
6. **Data Integrity:** Are we comfortable with dynamic data mapping risks?

**Recommended Decision Process:**
1. Review analysis and ask clarifying questions (15 min)
2. Discuss concerns and alternatives (10 min)
3. Formal vote or consensus decision (5 min)
4. Document decision and rationale (immediately after meeting)

**Reality Check:** Option A cannot meet the hard deadline. The real question is whether to proceed with Option B or negotiate a new timeline with the client.

---

## Slide 21: Questions & Discussion

**Key Questions to Consider:**

1. **Hard Deadline:** Can we miss the May 1, 2026 completion requirement?

2. **Contract:** Can we delay project delivery by 6+ months?

3. **Penalties:** What are the financial and relationship costs of missing deadlines?

4. **Risk:** Are we comfortable with the data integrity risks of Option A?

5. **Value:** Does the Enrollment Builder deliver sufficient ROI to justify missing deadlines?

6. **Resources:** Can we continue allocating 50%+ of engineering to the Builder?

7. **Alternatives:** Should we consider commercial form solutions in Phase 2?

8. **Reality:** Is Option A even viable given the hard deadline?
