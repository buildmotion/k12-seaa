---

## Cost Savings (Annual)

### 1. Rule Change Development Savings

**Without Rules Engine:**
- 20 rule changes per year (legislative, operational)
- Average 11-17 days per change (14 days average)
- Developer time: 14 days × $1,200/day = $16,800 per change
- **Annual cost: 20 × $16,800 = $336,000**

**With Rules Engine:**
- 20 rule changes per year
- Average 1-2 days per change (1.5 days average)
- Business analyst time: 1.5 days × $800/day = $1,200 per change
- **Annual cost: 20 × $1,200 = $24,000**

**Annual Savings: $336,000 - $24,000 = $312,000**

*Note: Conservative estimate assumes only 20 changes. Actual may be 15-25.*

**Revised Conservative Savings: $180,000** (assuming efficiency gains)

---

### 2. Deployment Cost Savings

**Without Rules Engine:**
- 20 production deployments per year (one per rule change)
- Each deployment requires:
  - Code review: 4 hours × $150/hr = $600
  - Testing: 8 hours × $100/hr = $800
  - Deployment: 2 hours × $150/hr = $300
  - Monitoring: 2 hours × $125/hr = $250
  - **Cost per deployment: $1,950**
- **Annual cost: 20 × $1,950 = $39,000**

**Additional deployment risks:**
- Production incidents: 4/year × $5,000 each = $20,000
- Emergency hotfixes: 3/year × $7,000 each = $21,000
- **Risk cost: $41,000**

**Total Annual Deployment Cost: $80,000**

**With Rules Engine:**
- 6 production deployments per year (platform changes only)
- Rule changes deployed via rules engine (no code deployment)
- **Annual cost: 6 × $1,950 = $11,700**
- Reduced incident rate: 1/year × $3,000 = $3,000
- **Total: $14,700**

**Annual Savings: $80,000 - $14,700 = $65,300**

**Rounded Savings: $55,000**

---

### 3. Defect Resolution Savings

**Without Rules Engine:**
- 65% of production defects are business logic errors (observed)
- Estimated 60 business logic defects per year
- Average resolution cost:
  - Investigation: 4 hours × $150/hr = $600
  - Fix: 6 hours × $125/hr = $750
  - Testing: 4 hours × $100/hr = $400
  - Deployment: 2 hours × $150/hr = $300
  - **Cost per defect: $2,050**
- **Annual cost: 60 × $2,050 = $123,000**

**With Rules Engine:**
- 65% reduction in business logic defects (rules tested independently)
- 21 business logic defects per year (35% of 60)
- Same cost per defect: $2,050
- **Annual cost: 21 × $2,050 = $43,050**

**Annual Savings: $123,000 - $43,050 = $79,950**

**Rounded Savings: $80,000**

---

### 4. Testing Overhead Savings

**Without Rules Engine:**
- Every rule change requires full regression testing
- 20 rule changes per year
- Regression test cycle: 5 days × $1,000/day = $5,000
- **Annual cost: 20 × $5,000 = $100,000**

**With Rules Engine:**
- Rule changes require only rule-specific testing
- 20 rule changes per year
- Rule test cycle: 2 days × $1,000/day = $2,000
- **Annual cost: 20 × $2,000 = $40,000**

**Annual Savings: $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000**

---

### 5. Documentation & Audit Savings

**Without Rules Engine:**
- Hard-coded rules require manual documentation
- Audit trail created manually
- Compliance reviews require developer explanation
- **Estimated annual cost: $50,000**
  - Documentation: $20,000
  - Audit support: $20,000
  - Compliance reviews: $10,000

**With Rules Engine:**
- Rules self-documenting
- Automatic audit trail
- Business stakeholders review rules directly
- **Estimated annual cost: $15,000**
  - Minor documentation updates: $10,000
  - Audit support: $5,000 (minimal)

**Annual Savings: $50,000 - $15,000 = $35,000**

---

---

## Return on Investment (ROI)

### ROI Calculation

**ROI Formula:** (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100%

**3-Year ROI:**
- Total Benefits: $1,059,200
- Total Costs: $403,500
- ROI = ($1,059,200 - $403,500) / $403,500 × 100%
- **ROI = 162.5%**

*Note: This is total ROI over 3 years, not annualized*

### Annualized ROI (Years 2-3)

**Year 2-3 ROI (Steady State):**
- Annual Benefits: $410,000
- Annual Costs: $70,000
- Annual ROI = ($410,000 - $70,000) / $70,000 × 100%
- **Annualized ROI = 486%** (after payback)

---

## Net Present Value (NPV)

### Assumptions
- Discount Rate: 10% (typical IT project)
- 3-year analysis period
- End-of-year cash flows

### NPV Calculation

| Year | Cash Flow | Discount Factor | Present Value |
|------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Year 0** | -$225,000 | 1.000 | -$225,000 |
| **Year 1** | +$201,000 * | 0.909 | +$182,709 |
| **Year 2** | +$340,000 | 0.826 | +$280,840 |
| **Year 3** | +$340,000 | 0.751 | +$255,340 |
| **NPV (3-year)** | | | **+$493,889** |

*Year 1 cash flow: -$38,500 operating + $239,200 savings = +$200,700*

**Interpretation:** At 10% discount rate, the project creates nearly **$500,000** in present value over 3 years.

---

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Best Case Scenario (Optimistic)

**Assumptions:**
- 25 rule changes per year (high legislative activity)
- 70% defect reduction (better than estimated)
- Faster deployment (1 day vs 1.5 days average)

| Year | Net Benefit |
|------|-------------|
| Year 1 | +$50,000 |
| Year 2 | +$450,000 |
| Year 3 | +$450,000 |
| **3-Year Total** | **+$950,000** |
| **3-Year ROI** | **235%** |

---

### Worst Case Scenario (Pessimistic)

**Assumptions:**
- Only 15 rule changes per year (low legislative activity)
- 50% defect reduction (less than estimated)
- Implementation overruns by 20% ($270K total)

| Year | Net Benefit |
|------|-------------|
| Year 1 | -$70,000 |
| Year 2 | +$270,000 |
| Year 3 | +$270,000 |
| **3-Year Total** | **+$470,000** |
| **3-Year ROI** | **107%** |
| **Payback** | 12 months (vs 8 months base) |

**Interpretation:** Even in worst case, ROI is positive and payback occurs within 1 year.

---

### Most Likely Scenario (Realistic)

**Assumptions:**
- 20 rule changes per year (historical average)
- 65% defect reduction (as estimated)
- Implementation on budget

| Year | Net Benefit |
|------|-------------|
| Year 1 | -$24,300 |
| Year 2 | +$340,000 |
| Year 3 | +$340,000 |
| **3-Year Total** | **+$655,700** |
| **3-Year ROI** | **162.5%** |
| **Payback** | 8 months |

---

## Break-Even Analysis

### Payback Period Calculation

**Monthly Benefit:** $410,000 / 12 = $34,167/month

**Time to Recover Investment:**
- Initial investment: $225,000
- Monthly net benefit (after operating costs): $34,167 - $5,833 = $28,334
- Payback period: $225,000 / $28,334 = 7.94 months

**Payback Period: 8 months** (end of Month 8 after launch)

## Comparison to Alternative Scenarios

### Scenario A: Implement Rules Engine (Recommended)

**3-Year Financial Summary:**
- Total Investment: $403,500
- Total Benefits: $1,059,200
- **Net Value: +$655,700**
- **ROI: 162.5%**

---

### Scenario B: Do NOT Implement (Status Quo)

**3-Year Financial Summary:**
- Continued inefficiency costs: $410,000 × 3 = $1,230,000
- No investment required: $0
- **Net Value: -$1,230,000** (opportunity cost)

**Comparison:**
- **Difference: $1,885,700 in favor of Scenario A**

---

### Scenario C: Defer to Year 2 (Wait and See)

**Assumptions:**
- Defer decision for 1 year
- Implement in Year 2
- Lose Year 1 benefits

**3-Year Financial Summary:**
- Year 1: Status quo inefficiencies (-$410,000)
- Year 2: Implementation (-$225,000) + partial benefits (+$200,000)
- Year 3: Full operation (+$340,000)
- **Net Value: -$95,000** (over 3 years)

**Comparison to Scenario A:**
- **Difference: $750,700 in favor of implementing now**
- **Lost opportunity: $410,000 (Year 1) + $140,000 (Year 2 partial)**

**Conclusion:** Deferring implementation destroys value. The sooner implemented, the better.

## Risk-Adjusted Value

### Risk Factors

**Implementation Risk:**
- Probability of 20% cost overrun: 30%
- Probability of schedule delay (3 months): 20%
- Expected cost impact: $225K × 1.06 = $238.5K

**Benefit Realization Risk:**
- Probability of achieving 80% of estimated savings: 25%
- Probability of achieving 100% of estimated savings: 60%
- Probability of exceeding savings by 10%: 15%
- Expected annual benefit: $410K × 0.96 = $393.6K

**Risk-Adjusted NPV:**
- Implementation cost: $238.5K (vs $225K)
- Annual benefits: $393.6K (vs $410K)
- **Risk-Adjusted 3-Year NPV: +$450,000** (vs $494K base case)

**Interpretation:** Even with risk adjustments, NPV remains strongly positive.

### Decision Recommendation

**IMPLEMENT RULES ENGINE IMMEDIATELY**

**Financial Justification:**
1. ✅ **Payback in 8 months** - Investment recovered quickly
2. ✅ **162.5% ROI over 3 years** - Excellent return
3. ✅ **$494K NPV** - Strong value creation
4. ✅ **Positive in all scenarios** - Even worst case yields 107% ROI
5. ✅ **$1M+ qualitative benefits** - Additional strategic value

**Alternative (Do NOT Implement):**
- ❌ Loses $410K/year in inefficiency costs
