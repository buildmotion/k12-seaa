## Priority-Ranked Questions

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Must Answer in This Meeting

#### 1. Integration Feasibility
**Q:** Does RDS provide a programmatic API (REST, SOAP, or other) for third-party systems to integrate with?

**Why Critical:** If no API exists, entire integration approach must pivot to manual process or alternative verification methods.

**Follow-ups:**
- If yes: Can we get API documentation today?
- If yes: When can we get sandbox access?
- If no: Is API development on the roadmap? What timeline?
- If no: What alternatives exist (batch files, shared database, portal-only)?

---

#### 2. K-12 Program Support
**Q:** Is RDS designed to support K-12 scholarship residency verification, or only higher education?

**Why Critical:** May discover RDS is out-of-scope for K-12, requiring completely different approach.

**Follow-ups:**
- Are there any K-12 programs currently using RDS?
- What would be required to extend RDS for K-12 use cases?
- Is there a different residency verification system for K-12?

---

#### 3. Integration Timeline
**Q:** What is the typical timeline from initial request to production integration for a new consumer?

**Why Critical:** K-12 system launch timeline depends on RDS integration availability.

**Follow-ups:**
- What are the steps in the onboarding process?
- What approvals or agreements are required (MOU, security review)?
- Who are the decision-makers we need to work with?
- Can we fast-track if executive sponsorship exists?

---

#### 4. Authentication & Authorization
**Q:** What authentication mechanism is required for API access?

**Why Critical:** Security architecture design depends on auth method (OAuth, API keys, certs, etc.).

**Follow-ups:**
- Is OAuth 2.0 supported?
- Are API keys issued per environment (dev, staging, prod)?
- What authorization scopes/permissions exist?
- How are credentials rotated and managed?

---

#### 5. Real-Time vs. Batch
**Q:** Does RDS support real-time API calls, or only batch/asynchronous processing?

**Why Critical:** User experience design (immediate feedback vs. async notifications) depends on this.

**Follow-ups:**
- What is typical response time for residency determination?
- Can we poll for status updates? At what frequency?
- Are webhooks available for status change notifications?

## Scenarios & Use Cases to Discuss

### Scenario 1: New K-12 Application (Happy Path)
**User Story:** Parent submits Opportunity Scholarship application for student who just moved to NC

**Workflow:**
1. Parent completes application in MyPortal
2. K-12 system checks if RDS case exists for student
3. No case found â†’ Create new RDS case via API
4. RDS prompts parent to upload NC driver's license and utility bill
5. RDS auto-validates driver's license with DMV
6. RDS determines: RESIDENT (12-month requirement met)
7. K-12 system proceeds with eligibility calculation and award

**Questions:**
- Can steps 2-6 complete in <5 seconds for good UX?
- Can we embed RDS document upload UI in MyPortal (white-label)?
- How do we handle cases where determination takes 24-48 hours (manual review)?

---

### Scenario 2: Returning Student (Cache Hit)
**User Story:** Student had Opportunity Scholarship last year, renewing for 2025-26

**Workflow:**
1. Parent submits renewal application in MyPortal
2. K-12 system checks if RDS case exists for student
3. Case found â†’ Retrieve current determination: RESIDENT (valid until 2026-07-31)
4. K-12 system proceeds immediately with renewal (no re-verification needed)

**Questions:**
- Can we cache determination locally to avoid repeated API calls?
- How do we detect if determination has been invalidated (e.g., student moved)?
- Should we re-verify residency annually or trust RDS expiration date?

---

### Scenario 3: Borderline Case (Manual Review)
**User Story:** Military family stationed in NC but maintaining legal residence in VA

**Workflow:**
1. Parent submits application and indicates military status
2. K-12 system creates RDS case with military exemption flag
3. RDS escalates to manual review (not auto-approved)
4. NCSEAA staff reviewer requests additional documentation (military orders)
5. Staff approves: RESIDENT (military exemption)
6. K-12 system receives notification and proceeds with award

**Questions:**
- How long does manual review typically take (days? weeks?)
- Can we track case status programmatically (e.g., status = "PENDING_REVIEW")?
- Are webhooks available to notify K-12 system when review completes?
- Should K-12 system send proactive reminders to parent while case is pending?

---

### Scenario 4: Non-Resident Outcome
**User Story:** Student recently moved to NC from FL, only 6 months of domicile

**Workflow:**
1. Parent submits application
2. RDS determines: NON-RESIDENT (does not meet 12-month requirement)
3. K-12 system denies scholarship eligibility
4. Parent receives notification with instructions to reapply after 12 months

**Questions:**
- Can parent request reconsideration via API or only manual process?
- How do we handle partial residency (6 months in NC, will reach 12 months mid-year)?
- Should we proactively calculate "eligible date" and notify parent when to reapply?

---

### Scenario 5: RDS System Outage
**User Story:** Parent submits application during RDS maintenance window

**Workflow (Proposed):**
1. Parent submits application
2. K-12 system calls RDS API â†’ 503 Service Unavailable
3. Circuit breaker trips, falls back to manual verification
4. K-12 system prompts parent to upload residency documents directly to MyPortal
5. NCSEAA staff manually reviews documents and updates K-12 system
6. When RDS returns to service, staff creates retroactive RDS case for audit trail

**Questions:**
- Is this fallback approach acceptable to NCSEAA leadership?
- How do we prevent fraud during manual verification?
- What is typical RDS downtime duration (minutes? hours?)?
- Do you provide advance notice of maintenance windows?

## Key Talking Points

### Value Proposition for RDS Team
**Why integrating K-12 is beneficial for RDS:**
- Expands RDS scope beyond higher-ed to K-12 market (30,000+ Opportunity Scholarship students)
- Demonstrates statewide residency verification platform vision
- Reduces redundant verification across NCSEAA programs
- Centralizes compliance and audit trail for all state aid programs
- Positions RDS as authoritative source for NC residency across all education levels

### K-12 Business Requirements
**What K-12 system must accomplish:**
- Verify residency for ~30,000 Opportunity Scholarship applicants annually
- Verify residency for ~12,000 ESA+ applicants annually
- Peak load: Feb-Apr (application windows)
- Must comply with G.S. 115C-562.3 statutory requirements
- Must support audit and compliance reporting
- Must provide timely parent/student notifications

### Non-Negotiables for K-12 System
**Integration requirements we cannot compromise on:**
1. **Security:** Must meet NIST 800-53 and FERPA standards
2. **Performance:** <5 second response time for real-time queries (if synchronous)
3. **Reliability:** Fallback mechanism required if RDS unavailable
4. **Auditability:** Complete audit trail for all residency determinations
5. **Data Privacy:** PII must be encrypted at rest and in transit

---

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Risk: No API Available (RDS is Portal-Only)
**Mitigation:**
- Negotiate portal access for NCSEAA K-12 staff
- Build manual verification workflow in MyPortal
- Advocate for API development on RDS roadmap (offer to co-fund)
- Explore alternative verification via DMV/DPI APIs directly

### Risk: K-12 Not in Scope for RDS
**Mitigation:**
- Escalate to NCSEAA executive leadership for strategic alignment
- Build business case (cost savings, consistency, audit benefits)
- Offer to fund development of K-12 module within RDS
- Implement interim solution (manual verification) until RDS extended

### Risk: Long Integration Timeline (6+ Months)
**Mitigation:**
- Fast-track by offering dedicated developer resources
- Simplify scope (read-only integration first, write operations later)
- Negotiate interim data sharing arrangement (batch files)
- Implement phased rollout (pilot with 10% of applications)

### Risk: Unacceptable Performance (Slow API)
**Mitigation:**
- Implement async workflow (notify parent when determination complete)
- Aggressive caching strategy (cache determinations for 30 days)
- Batch operations during off-peak hours
- Pre-create RDS cases for returning students
