# Research Documents - Domain-Driven Design for K-12 Scholarship Programs

This folder contains comprehensive research and documentation on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for the North Carolina K-12 Scholarship Administration system.

## Documents Overview

### üìò For IT Stakeholders NEW TO Domain-Driven Design
**Start here:** [`ddd-primer-for-stakeholders.md`](./ddd-primer-for-stakeholders.md)

This primer is designed for IT stakeholders, managers, and team members who are not familiar with Domain-Driven Design. It provides:
- Plain-English explanations of DDD concepts (Entity, Aggregate, Value Object, Domain Events, etc.)
- Real examples from ESA+ and Opportunity Scholarship programs
- Five detailed workflows showing how domain objects work together
- Visual diagrams and concrete scenarios
- Clear explanations of relationships between domain objects
- FAQ section addressing common questions
- Glossary of DDD terms

**Best for:** Non-technical stakeholders, new team members, anyone wanting a comprehensive introduction to how DDD applies to our system.

### üî¨ For Deep Technical Research
**Comprehensive domain analysis:** [`ddd-1.md`](./ddd-1.md)

In-depth domain analysis across all NCSEAA programs including:
- Domain inventory (nouns) by area
- Behavior inventory (verbs) with anchors
- Canonical workflows (happy paths)
- Bounded contexts and core aggregates
- Inter-context relationships and dependencies
- Domain events
- C4 diagrams (context, container, component)
- Policy anchors encoded as invariants

**Best for:** Architects, senior developers, anyone doing comprehensive system design.

---

### üéØ For Focused ESA+ and Opportunity Scholarship Work
**Focused K-12 analysis:** [`ddd-2.md`](./ddd-2.md)

Targeted domain research on ESA+ and Opportunity Scholarship programs:
- ESA+ domain nouns (entities, value objects, concepts) with descriptions
- Aggregate suggestions and bounded contexts
- Verbs/Actions/Workflows specific to K-12 programs
- Opportunity Scholarship key differences and overlaps
- Preliminary domain model sketch

**Best for:** Developers working specifically on K-12 scholarship features.

---

### üìã For Detailed Aggregate Specifications
**Enhanced aggregate details:** [`aggregate-details-enhancement.md`](./aggregate-details-enhancement.md)

Comprehensive documentation of domain aggregates and entities including:
- Domain role & usage for each aggregate
- Complete attribute descriptions
- Relationships & dependencies
- Concrete workflow examples
- Methods/operations with business logic
- Invariants and business rules
- Implementation recommendations

**Best for:** Developers implementing specific aggregates, reviewing detailed specifications.

---

### üìä Full Domain Documentation
**Complete domain model:** [`full-domain.md`](./full-domain.md) and [`full-domain.pdf`](./full-domain.pdf)

Complete domain model documentation covering the entire NCSEAA ecosystem.

**Best for:** Reference material, comprehensive system overview.

### üîç RDS Residency Verification System Research

**‚≠ê START HERE:** [`rds-executive-summary.md`](./rds-executive-summary.md)

Quick reference and executive summary of RDS research:
- Research documents overview
- Key findings (what we know vs. don't know)
- Critical questions for meeting
- Blind spots and risks
- Pre-meeting checklist
- Next steps and action items

**Comprehensive RDS research:** [`rds-residency-verification-system.md`](./rds-residency-verification-system.md)

Deep technical and business research on the North Carolina Residency Determination Service (RDS):
- Business overview and organizational structure
- System architecture (Level 1-11 technical depth)
- Integration specifications and patterns
- Data models and API endpoints (hypothetical)
- Security, compliance, and state agency coordination
- Critical blind spots and risk areas
- Integration roadmap

**Meeting preparation guide:** [`rds-meeting-preparation.md`](./rds-meeting-preparation.md)

Structured meeting agenda and questions for RDS system owners:
- Priority-ranked questions (Critical, High, Medium)
- Integration scenarios and use cases
- Information to request
- Success criteria and follow-up actions
- Risk mitigation strategies

**Integration specification template:** [`rds-integration-specification.md`](./rds-integration-specification.md)

Technical specification template to be completed after RDS discovery meeting:
- API endpoints and authentication
- Data models and schemas
- Performance SLAs and rate limits
- Error handling and retry strategies
- Security, monitoring, and support

**Best for:** Architects preparing for RDS integration, system owners meeting preparation, technical planning.

## Recommended Reading Path

### If you're new to DDD:
1. Start with [`ddd-primer-for-stakeholders.md`](./ddd-primer-for-stakeholders.md)
2. Then read [`ddd-2.md`](./ddd-2.md) for ESA+ specifics
3. Refer to [`aggregate-details-enhancement.md`](./aggregate-details-enhancement.md) when implementing

### If you're familiar with DDD:
1. Review [`ddd-2.md`](./ddd-2.md) for K-12 program specifics
2. Reference [`aggregate-details-enhancement.md`](./aggregate-details-enhancement.md) for implementation details
3. Check [`ddd-1.md`](./ddd-1.md) for cross-program context

### If you're an architect:
1. Start with [`ddd-1.md`](./ddd-1.md) for system-wide view
2. Review [`ddd-2.md`](./ddd-2.md) for K-12 bounded contexts
3. Use [`ddd-primer-for-stakeholders.md`](./ddd-primer-for-stakeholders.md) to communicate with non-technical stakeholders
