## Azure Native Technologies

### 1. Azure Durable Functions

**Overview:**  
Azure Durable Functions is an extension of Azure Functions that enables writing stateful workflows in serverless compute environments using standard programming languages ([Microsoft Learn: Durable Functions Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview)).

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Stateful Orchestration:** Write workflows as orchestrator functions with automatic state management and checkpoints
- **Programming Model:** Use C#, JavaScript, Python, or PowerShell to define workflows as code
- **Application Patterns:** Supports function chaining, fan-out/fan-in, async HTTP APIs, monitoring, and human interaction patterns
- **Automatic Checkpoints:** State is persisted automatically, allowing workflows to resume after interruptions
- **Built-in Retries:** Configurable retry policies with exponential backoff
- **Long-running Support:** Can run for days, weeks, or months with minimal cost due to serverless pricing model

**Architecture:**

```mermaid
graph TB
    Client[Client Application]
    Orchestrator[Orchestrator Function]
    Activity1[Activity Function 1]
    Activity2[Activity Function 2]
    Activity3[Activity Function 3]
    Storage[Azure Storage Account]
    
    Client -->|Start workflow| Orchestrator
    Orchestrator -->|State persistence| Storage
    Orchestrator -->|Execute| Activity1
    Orchestrator -->|Execute| Activity2
    Orchestrator -->|Execute| Activity3
    Activity1 -->|Complete| Orchestrator
    Activity2 -->|Complete| Orchestrator
    Activity3 -->|Complete| Orchestrator
    Storage -->|Resume state| Orchestrator
    Orchestrator -->|Status/result| Client
```

**Example Workflow Pattern:**

```csharp
[FunctionName("ApplicationProcessingOrchestrator")]
public static async Task<string> RunOrchestrator(
    [OrchestrationTrigger] IDurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    var application = context.GetInput<Application>();
    
    // Step 1: Validate application
    await context.CallActivityAsync("ValidateApplication", application);
    
    // Step 2: Verify residency (external RDS call)
    var residencyVerified = await context.CallActivityAsync<bool>(
        "VerifyResidency", application.StudentId);
    
    if (!residencyVerified)
    {
        await context.CallActivityAsync("SendRejectionEmail", application);
        return "Rejected";
    }
    
    // Step 3: Wait for document upload (could take days)
    await context.WaitForExternalEvent("DocumentsUploaded");
    
    // Step 4: Review documents
    var approved = await context.CallActivityAsync<bool>(
        "ReviewDocuments", application);
    
    // Step 5: Create award
    if (approved)
    {
        await context.CallActivityAsync("CreateAward", application);
        await context.CallActivityAsync("SendApprovalEmail", application);
    }
    
    return approved ? "Approved" : "Rejected";
}
```

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Event Sources"
        BlobStorage[Azure Blob Storage]
        CustomApp[Custom Application]
        ServiceBus[Service Bus]
    end
    
    EventGrid[Azure Event Grid<br/>Topic]
    
    subgraph "Event Handlers"
        Function1[Azure Function]
        LogicApp[Logic App]
        WebHook[WebHook Endpoint]
        Queue[Storage Queue]
    end
    
    BlobStorage -->|Blob Created Event| EventGrid
    CustomApp -->|Domain Event| EventGrid
    ServiceBus -->|Message Event| EventGrid
    
    EventGrid -->|Filter: Type=DocumentUploaded| Function1
    EventGrid -->|Filter: Type=PaymentCompleted| LogicApp
    EventGrid -->|All Events| WebHook
    EventGrid -->|Dead Letter| Queue
```

**Event-Driven Patterns:**

1. **Event Notification:** Inform subscribers about state changes
2. **Event Sourcing:** Store events as source of truth
3. **CQRS:** Separate command and query responsibilities
4. **Saga Pattern:** Coordinate distributed transactions

**Example Domain Events for K-12:**

```csharp
// Application domain events
public class ApplicationSubmittedEvent
{
    public Guid ApplicationId { get; set; }
    public Guid StudentId { get; set; }
    public DateTime SubmittedAt { get; set; }
    public string ProgramType { get; set; } // "ESA+" or "OS"
}

public class DocumentUploadedEvent
{
    public Guid ApplicationId { get; set; }
    public string DocumentType { get; set; }
    public string BlobUrl { get; set; }
    public DateTime UploadedAt { get; set; }
}

public class AwardCreatedEvent
{
    public Guid AwardId { get; set; }
    public Guid StudentId { get; set; }
    public decimal Amount { get; set; }
    public string Program { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
}
```

**Publishing Events:**

```csharp
public class EventPublisher
{
    private readonly EventGridPublisherClient _client;
    
    public async Task PublishApplicationSubmittedAsync(Application application)
    {
        var eventData = new EventGridEvent(
            subject: $"applications/{application.Id}",
            eventType: "K12.Application.Submitted",
            dataVersion: "1.0",
            data: new ApplicationSubmittedEvent
            {
                ApplicationId = application.Id,
                StudentId = application.StudentId,
                SubmittedAt = DateTime.UtcNow,
                ProgramType = application.ProgramType
            });
            
        await _client.SendEventAsync(eventData);
    }
}
```

**Pros:**
