# K-12 SEAA Workflow Architecture Research

**Document Purpose:** Comprehensive research and analysis of workflow orchestration technologies and architectures for the North Carolina K-12 Scholarship Administration system

**Last Updated:** October 22, 2025  
**Technology Focus:** Azure-native, .NET-based, Event-driven, Microservices

---

## Executive Summary

This research package addresses the critical need for a systematic workflow orchestration approach in the K-12 SEAA system. The current "task engine" implementation is a naive approach that lacks workflow state management, sequencing, and orchestration capabilities. This research evaluates Azure-native and .NET-based workflow solutions to provide a comprehensive path forward.

### Key Findings

1. **Workflow Engine is Essential**: With 100+ identified workflows across 4 applications (Admin, Providers, Schools, Households), a proper workflow engine is critical for managing complex, long-running processes.

2. **Azure Provides Multiple Solutions**: Azure offers complementary technologies (Durable Functions, Logic Apps, Event Grid) that can work together to address different workflow needs.

3. **.NET Ecosystem is Rich**: Multiple mature .NET workflow engines (Elsa, MassTransit, Workflow Core) provide flexibility for backend implementation.

4. **Hybrid Approach Recommended**: Combination of Azure-native services for orchestration and .NET libraries for business logic provides optimal balance.

## Key Questions Answered

✅ **Do we need a workflow engine?** Yes, absolutely. The complexity and scale of K-12 workflows demand proper orchestration.

✅ **What technologies should we use?** Hybrid approach: Azure Durable Functions + Elsa Workflows + Azure Event Grid

✅ **How do we handle long-running workflows?** Durable Functions and Elsa both support persistent state for long-running processes

✅ **How do we integrate third-party services?** Event Grid + Service Bus for reliable async integration patterns

✅ **How do we track workflow state?** Database-backed state persistence with Azure SQL + Redis caching

✅ **How do we send emails and notifications?** Event-driven triggers with Azure Functions + SendGrid/Azure Communication Services

✅ **How do we handle existing tasks?** Incremental migration with coexistence patterns during transition

✅ **Should we use a rules engine?** Yes, absolutely. Rules engine complements workflows by separating business rule evaluation from orchestration logic. See [Rules Engine Evaluation](./07-rules-engine-evaluation.md) for comprehensive analysis.
